**Hello World!**

I wanted to start blogging years ago and it's time to start. I've chosen [Ghost](https://ghost.org) for my blog, hosted it on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=6f84941d4d97) and bought template made by [EckoThemes](http://ecko.me) from [ThemeForest](http://themeforest.net/?ref=VorT3x).

Mostly I'll write technical articles. Currently I feel real passion to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and want to dig it further, that's one of the reasons why I've chosen [Ghost](https://ghost.org) for blogging, since it's built on Node.js. I really like how simple it's comparable to [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) and it uses Markdown syntax for posts, which is also pleasant to use.

Stay tuned!
